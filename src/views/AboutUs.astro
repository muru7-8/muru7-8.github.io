      The collective's intention transforms into a quest for new cooperation
      systems. They enable tecno-poetic devices that awaken knowledge ethically
      aligned with the territory, interweaving various fields of contemporary
      and indigenous knowledge. They generate non-hegemonic narratives that
      prompt us to reconsider and rediscover non-human languages, subverting the
      technological order through open-source development and easy
      socialization.
