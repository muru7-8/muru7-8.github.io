    The Namiki project invites us to perceive the resonances of minimal events
    in our environment and discover through its sensing and audiovisual
    crystallization, the connection between living entities. We have developed a
    research model to sense the expanding vector force of different entities,
    particularly observing the energetic and vibrational aspect of the movement
    of bodies in physical space and their interaction.
  </p>
  <p class="my-10">
    The artgame Namiki Virtual Universe proposes to the user a non-linear drift
    towards lithic crystallizations orbiting in the cosmos, emerging from our
    observatory of resonances. Onto them are projected videos bearing witness to
    the biosensed data. Poetic and philosophical texts serve as keys, unlocking
    new pathways to assist us in contemplating the energetic, vibrational, and
    indissoluble nature of living entities.
